{examples}

Based on your previous GIF analyses, I'd like you to create a new concept that incorporates the key elements from this analysis:

scenario: {scenario}
objects: {objects}
static_patterns: {static_patterns}
dynamic_patterns: {dynamic_patterns}
interactions: {interactions}
core_principles: {core_principles}

Brainstorm one more.

If the above informations involves gradual changes over time or a process of reaching a clear goal state, the input and output grids should not merely depict a short-term or single-frame transition. Instead, they should be designed to capture the entire transformation process from the initial state to the final state. When temporal progression or cumulative change is central to the analogy, construct the puzzle's code so that this flow and its outcome are clearly reflected through the difference between input and output.

In this case, please create concepts and descriptions that effectively incorporate the above visual elements, static patterns, dynamic patterns, and core principles, following the format below, while referencing previous examples.
```python
# concepts:
# <concepts in your new generation>

# description:
# <description of your new generation>
```
