# GIF Analysis Request

Please analyze the attached GIF frame by frame and provide a structured response that identifies core reasoning elements and patterns.

## Visual Analysis
1. Detailed scenario description: Describe the overall narrative of the GIF
2. Object inventory:
   - List all explicit objects (physical entities with clear boundaries)
   - List all implicit objects (formed by groups of smaller objects creating recognizable patterns)
   - For composite objects: {participating objects, participation method, number of participants, resulting object}
   - Create a 2D array representation of key objects (scale the frame so the longer dimension equals 30)

## Pattern Analysis
1. Static patterns:
   - Identify elements and relationships that remain consistent throughout the GIF
   - Describe spatial arrangements, backgrounds, or design features that don't change
   - List all constant patterns or objects

2. Dynamic patterns:
   - Describe how elements interact and change over time
   - Specify whether changes occur gradually, abruptly, or through multi-stage transformations
   - Format interactions as: {"Objects involved": [], "Type of interaction": "", "Interaction parameters": []}

## Core Principles
1. Identify the general reasoning principles that explain how and why the dynamic elements change
2. Categorize each interaction as one of:
   - Clear analogy (explicit objects with defined parameters)
   - Ambiguous analogy (implicit objects with indirect parameters)
   - Constraint analogy (limiting behaviors or interactions)
   - Poetic analogy (metaphorical expressions derived from other analogies)
3. Summarize the single most fundamental principle in one concise sentence
4. Suggest 2-3 similar situations or metaphors that follow the same core principle

Please format your response as a structured list for each section, not as long paragraphs, and include a JSON representation of your analysis.
